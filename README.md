# Computational Physics
## Project 1
Solving the matrix equation Ax=b when A is a Toeplitz matrix.
We compare a general, optimized and the LU-decomposition algorithm.

The program
```
project1.py
```
Program: Has two query inputs:
first specifies whether to run general, special or LU-decomposition algorithm.
second specifies whether to plot approx to analytical solutions in same plot
or plot the relative error.
Depends on the following programs:
```
project1.cpp, project1_imp.cpp, project1_LU.cpp
```
## Project 2
Computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix using the
Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm.

## Project 4
Simulating the ising model by the applied Metropolis-algorithm.
